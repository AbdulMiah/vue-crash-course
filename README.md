# Task Tracker - Vue.js

This project was completed following the [Vue JS Crash Course 2021 from Traversy Media on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZXt1Aom3Cs). This challenge allowed me to understand the fundamentals of Vue.js and help build my skills in creating dynamic frontend apps/websites.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Add new tasks
  - Can add a date and time for the task
  - Can set reminder
- Can view tasks below the add task form
  - You can toggle set reminder by double clicking the task. A green bar will display on the side of the task component to demonstrate that the task has a reminder set
  - Can delete tasks by clicking the red cross button. This will permanently delete the task from the JSON file
- Can toggle 'add task' to hide or display the add task form

### What I learned



<!-- ```css

``` -->


### Continued development

<!-- In the future, I could focus on adding more elements/items for the background. At the moment, the background is white and plain, and I could have added extra elements to make it more interesting. This will help me improve my creativity and in the future, I could tackle projects with a more creative/innovative approach. -->


### Useful resources

<!-- - [@media query](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21075983/how-to-use-particular-css-styles-based-on-screen-size-device/45695130) - This helped me for changing CSS styles based on screen size on device. I really liked this CSS query and will use it going forward.
- [Bootstrap Grid](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/grid/) - This is an amazing library which helped me implement a responsive design. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to make their website responsive. -->
