# Task Tracker - Vue.js

This project was completed following the [Vue JS Crash Course 2021 from Traversy Media on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZXt1Aom3Cs). This challenge allowed me to understand the fundamentals of Vue.js and help build my skills in creating dynamic frontend apps/websites.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Add new tasks
  - Can add a date and time for the task
  - Can set reminder
- Can view tasks below the add task form
  - You can toggle set reminder by double clicking the task. A green bar will display on the side of the task component to demonstrate that the task has a reminder set
  - Can delete tasks by clicking the red cross button. This will permanently delete the task from the JSON file
- Can toggle 'add task' to hide or display the add task form

### What I learned

### Continued development

In the future, I would like to add an edit page that will allow the user to edit the tasks. This could be useful when, for example, you want to change a date or time on a task.
